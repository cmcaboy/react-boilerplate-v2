            Hi! My name is Cory McAboy. I currently live in Morris Plains, NJ. Professionally,
            I work as a product manager in the small business segment of ADP. I manage the 
            tax components of our small business payroll product offering. A typical day includes
            interviewing customers, building process flows or wire frames, explaining the product vision
            to my agile team, and crunching customer data. I am also actively involved
            with data insights within our group. I provide any adhoc data analysis that is requested, including
            retention, NPS, behavior analysis (w/ regression), and much more.
          </p>
          <br />

            On my freetime, I develop fullstack web and mobile applications. Using React and
            React Native, I have built products ranging from dating apps to mapping software. For my backend,
            I use Google as my cloud vendor and Node.js as my primary server-side language. I am consistently
            learning new technologies, strategies, and trends in the product space.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="work-aboutme-text">
            Socially, I enjoy travel, fitness, and friends. I am absolutely obsessed with physical 
            fitness. I will either run, bike, or swim almost every day.
